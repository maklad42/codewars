## Details

In a grid of 4 by 4 squares you want to place a skyscraper in each square with only some clues:

    The height of the skyscrapers is between 1 and 4
    No two skyscrapers in a row or column may have the same number of floors
    A clue is the number of skyscrapers that you can see in a row or column from the outside
    Higher skyscrapers block the view of lower skyscrapers located behind them

Can you write a program that can solve this puzzle?

Example:

To understand how the puzzle works, this is an example of a row with 2 clues. Seen from the left side there are 4 buildings visible while seen from the right side only 1:

4 1

There is only one way in which the skyscrapers can be placed. From left-to-right all four buildings must be visible and no building may hide behind another building:

4 1 2 3 4 1

Example of a 4 by 4 puzzle with the solution:

| \_ \_ _ 1 2 _
| \_ \_ \_ \_ \_ _
| _ \_ \_ \_ _ 2
| 1 _ \_ \_ \_ _
| _ \_ \_ \_ \_ _
| _ \_ _ 3 _ \_

| \_ \_ _ 1 2 _
| _ 2 1 4 3 _
| _ 3 4 1 2 2
| 1 4 2 3 1 _
| _ 1 3 2 4 _
| \_ \_ _ 3 _ \_

Task:

    Finish:

```
function solvePuzzle(clues)
```

    Pass the clues in an array of 16 items. This array contains the clues around the clock, index:
       	 0 	 1 	   2 	   3
     15 	   	   	   	   	 4
     14 	   	   	   	   	 5
     13 	   	   	   	   	 6
     12 	   	   	   	   	 7
       	11 	10 	 9 	 8
    If no clue is available, add value `0`
    Each puzzle has only one possible solution
    `SolvePuzzle()` returns matrix `int[][]`. The first indexer is for the row, the second indexer for the column. (Python: returns 4-tuple of 4-tuples, Ruby: 4-Array of 4-Arrays)
